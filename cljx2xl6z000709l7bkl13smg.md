I recently had an interesting encounter with a senior. In talking about AI (particularly explaining concepts like deep learning), a big question came up. Why? We (Software Engineers) sit in front of our laptops, training models, debugging code and consuming an awfully large amount of coffee. But why? What's the end goal? What type of world are we trying to build?

Well, Artificial intelligence (AI) has and will continue to change the way we live and work. Across all fields and industries, firms are leveraging the potential of AI to improve the accuracy, efficiency and even effectiveness of whatever it is they release to the public. The 'hype' around the concept of AI is growing exponentially and experts predict that it will continue to have an increasingly significant impact on our society. Here are some of the 'big' problems we are trying to solve effortlessly, using AI.

### ***Education:***

The traditional classroom experience is no longer the same thanks to the availability of AI-powered software. 'Edutainment' is now a big contributor to an educated and knowledgeable society (a result of interactive learning apps.) We see AI algorithms playing in the front lines, helping teachers gauge student performance and easily identifying areas for improvement. Additionally, AI-powered virtual tutors are providing personalized, one-to-one mentorship, which can be particularly beneficial for students with special needs. At the end of it all everyone gets exposed to all the important concepts in a way that is specific to what they need.

### ***Personalized Shopping:***

Ever wondered why you get ads about shoes on YouTube moments after googling "Where to get the cheapest pair of Chuck Tailors"? I, myself, face this situation daily. All my Google ads have something to do with coding boot camps and resources.

It's not magic. The realm of online shopping simply has been revolutionized by AI. Recommendations are now given based on individual preferences. Large banks of data are collected from your device to help in enhancing your satisfaction as a customer. Your browsing history, purchase patterns and likes on social media may not have much value to you but it's all collected and used in predictive algorithms to ensure that you get only the best deals FOR YOU. Yes, you can get discounts too ;)!

### ***Transportation and Navigation:***

With the help of AI, the transportation industry has gotten a significant revamp. AI algorithms have been employed by ride-hailing services like Uber and Vaya to optimize routes and predict which areas have greater demands (and, consequently, which areas need more vehicles). This creates a seamlessly efficient transport ecosystem for users.

Additionally, we can talk about autonomous vehicles. With a data bank of past traffic scenarios, we can be assured that the trained models will be safer, with the potential to reduce road accidents. The trained models can also employ intelligent traffic management systems which will effectively reduce travel/delivery times by alleviating congestion.

### ***Healthcare:***

AI is set to improve patient care, diagnosis and treatment procedures. Large volumes of patient data and medical records can be analyzed and aid in the provision of accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. Potential health risks can also be identified and proper measures can be taken to ensure patient comfort. With the use of AI-powered robots, monotonous tasks can be completed, thus reducing medical staff workload and improving overall medical center efficiency.

AI is also making waves in medical research. The way diseases are being studied is becoming better and better. How is this done? Well, the ability to analyze vast amounts of data in real time has enabled us to identify patterns and correlations that would have been otherwise too complex for us, humans, to discern. From this, new targets for drug developers can be identified, treatments tailored to individual genetic makeup can be used and accurate predictions of disease progression can be made.

To be honest, AI in medical research is my biggest area of interest and I would like to use the next couple of weeks to talk about it. Who's excited? Let me know in the comments below.
