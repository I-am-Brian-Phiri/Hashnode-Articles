The use of computers in the field of medicine has come a long way. From the use of Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scans in non-invasive diagnostics and digitized patient records, it is easy to deduce that the race towards maximum health for humanity is being run well. More recently, the subject of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making waves in major domains of expertise and some may be wondering, "What are the different ways in which AI could save our lives?" Well, a good start would be an act of giving medical practitioners an additional 'set of eyes.'

### What is Computer Vision anyway?

By definition, Computer Vision is one of the many branches of AI that gives computer systems a way of deriving meaningful information from one or more visual sources. This information is then used to either take an 'appropriate' action or give a useful recommendation. The virtue of being 'appropriate' or 'useful' stems from the fact that the aforementioned computer system takes advantage of machine learning and comprehensive neural networks. These concepts help computers 'understand' the world well enough to have a pretty good model of ideal circumstances.

In summary, Computer Vision works in a way similar to how the human brain works. Visual data is analyzed using special algorithms (much like how images are detected by the human eye) and models are trained to recognize patterns and features (which is done by neurons in human brains, through gaining knowledge and experience.)

### How is CV being used in Medicine now?

So many applications of Computer Vision exist in medicine's status quo. Patient monitoring has been made easier by way of providing doctors with valuable information to make the decision-making process easier. Early detection of terminal illnesses like cancer is now possible and measurements are now more accurate than they have ever been before. Here are some examples of Computer Vision in practical use:

1. ***Computer-navigated hip replacement.***
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693198253133/fb6d9fe1-2fa7-49e6-b6d1-c0135fd0fa5d.jpeg align="center")
    
    This is all about using computer systems that will take measurements before, during and after the hip replacement surgery. The main idea involves conceding to the fact that the human body has some complexities that may not be so apparent to the human eye (not to mention differences due to deformities, scar tissue or arthritis). The measurements taken would then be used by AI models to determine the best approach(es), tailored to one’s unique anatomy. Only appropriate incisions, best implants and even sleeping positions (during surgery) can be decided upon in a way that eliminates the complications that come with just ‘winging it'. Such an approach is paramount to avoiding complications. Additionally, if said complications presented themselves later on, they could be identified early. Penn surgeons are taking advantage of this technology to provide the best care to their patients. Read about how they do it [here](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/find-a-program-or-service/orthopaedics/hip-pain/hip-surgery/hip-replacement-surgery/computer-navigated-hip-replacements)
    
2. ***Planing with 2-D Radiographs***

    Similar to the computer-navigated hip replacement, this is a preoperative planning process. Digital templating is used on medical images to select from a variety of medical components (e.g. hip prostheses) and validate the components' appropriateness for certain procedures. With this technology, one might not need to travel too far before their surgery is planned. Medical images can be sent electronically and neural networks will work hand-in-hand with experts to pick out tools necessary for a successful procedure (along with appropriate sizes for said tools). Minwoo Kim, II-Seok Oh and Sun-Jung Yoon demonstrate the use of this very well in their 2022 research paper: [***Deep Learning and Computer Vision Techniques for Automated Total Hip Arthroplasty Planning on 2-D Radiographs***](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9875293)
    

### Where are we going with CV in medicine?

With this rapid growth, Computer Vision can be expected to continue transforming the healthcare industry. Already, we have come to see streamlined surgical approaches. In the future, we can anticipate improved disease detection, diagnosis and even treatment techniques. Automated (and complex) medical procedures will stop being a work of fiction in our favorite sci-fi movies. Additionally, with well-trained AI models, the mortality rate due to medical errors will plummet. All things look good overall. What changes are you expecting to see in the medical industry?
